# Hangman

## Setup

This program is my first Java project. It is a version of Hangman - first you have 
to select your difficulty level: easypeasy, mediumpeasy or hardpeasy by typing your
choice into the console. A filter of word length is applied to the textfile containing
the words in each case.

## Gameplay

The game presents you with word and asks you to guess a letter - feeding back whether
the guess was successful or not. If unsuccessful/the user guesses letter already guessed 
you lose a life After the 4th correct letter guess the program then prompts you to guess 
the word. You win the game by either guessing the correct word at this stage or guessing all
the letters. If you lose all of your lives the ASCII man is hung and the user is prompted
to say whether they would like to play another game.

## Learning

This project has helped to solidify my understanding of OOP principles, particularly 
polymorphism, abstraction and encapsulation. I have divided my project into classes,
following the single responsibility principle. I have also tried to incorporate my 
learning about enums to store constants abd related information.
